**Catalyst** cat\*a\*lyst - a person or thing that precipitates an event.

Sparking interest, investment and ideas into community spaces with public art. Through murals, sculptures and other artistic vessels this event aims to improve our surrounding environment with inspiration and decoration. Catalyst isn't just an art show, it doubles as a fundraiser with all proceeds benefiting Art on Main.
