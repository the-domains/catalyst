From moose-maker and pizza aficionado, to event planner and philanthropist, Matt Bero has may irons in the fire but his passion for the community and public arts always shines through. The latest project stems from a mountain of gratitude that he has for the organization, Olde Main Street, Inc.   
Olde Main Street, Inc. was an invaluable in helping create the opportunity for Morty to come to life. As a thank you and to show continued support in their mission and efforts for public arts, we're happy to announce, Catalyst Art Show. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d673a401-68a2-4c30-9977-60385968b229.jpg)
